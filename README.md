## 🧰 Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone Project leverages a combination of powerful technologies to build a scalable, secure, and maintainable web application. Each tool plays a specific role in the system architecture:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to develop the backend logic and handle requests, responses, and user authentication.

- **MySQL**: A reliable relational database management system used to store structured data like users, bookings, listings, and reviews.

- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility in data retrieval.

- **Docker**: A containerization tool that ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production by packaging the application with all its dependencies.

- **GitHub**: A version control platform for managing the codebase, collaborating with team members, and tracking changes through commits and pull requests.

- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool used to automate workflows, such as testing and deploying the application when code changes are pushed.

- **Markdown**: A lightweight markup language used to create formatted text for the project documentation, especially in `README.md` files.


## 🗃️ Database Design

The Airbnb Clone Project uses a relational database (MySQL) to manage structured data and relationships. Below are the key entities and their important fields:

### 1. **Users**
Represents users of the platform (both hosts and guests).
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name
- `email`: Email address (unique)
- `password`: Hashed password
- `is_host`: Boolean flag to determine if the user is a host

### 2. **Properties**
Represents listings available for booking.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Name of the property
- `description`: Detailed information about the property
- `price_per_night`: Cost of booking per night
- `host_id`: Foreign key linking to the `Users` table

### 3. **Bookings**
Tracks reservations made by users.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key linking to the user who made the booking
- `property_id`: Foreign key linking to the property booked
- `start_date`: Check-in date
- `end_date`: Check-out date

### 4. **Reviews**
Captures feedback from users about their stays.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key linking to the reviewer
- `property_id`: Foreign key linking to the property reviewed
- `rating`: Numeric score (e.g., 1 to 5)
- `comment`: Textual feedback

### 5. **Payments**
Handles transactions for bookings.
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Foreign key linking to the related booking
- `amount`: Total amount paid
- `payment_method`: e.g., Credit Card, PayPal
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., successful, failed)

---

### 🔗 Entity Relationships

- A **User** can list multiple **Properties** (one-to-many).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings** (one-to-many).
- A **Booking** is made for one **Property** and by one **User** (many-to-one).
- A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews** from different **Users** (one-to-many).
- Each **Booking** has one associated **Payment** (one-to-one).

This design ensures data integrity and models real-world relationships between users, listings, transactions, and feedback.

## 🚀 Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes several core features that replicate the functionality of a real-world booking platform. Each feature is designed to contribute to a seamless user experience and robust backend logic.

### 🔐 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature also distinguishes between guests and hosts using role-based logic.

### 🏠 Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes detailed descriptions, pricing, and availability information.

### 📆 Booking System
Lets users browse available properties and make reservations based on availability. The system handles date selection, overlapping booking checks, and booking confirmation.

### 💳 Payment Integration
Handles the payment processing for bookings, including calculating total costs and confirming transactions. This ensures a complete transaction loop for users.

### ⭐ Review System
Allows users to leave ratings and comments on properties they have booked. This helps build trust in the platform by enabling feedback and quality assurance.

### 🔒 API Security
Implements authentication and authorization using secure tokens to protect sensitive endpoints. Ensures that only verified users can access or modify resources.

### ⚙️ CI/CD & Deployment
Automates code testing and deployment using GitHub Actions and Docker. This streamlines development and ensures that new changes are safely deployed.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical aspect of any web application, especially one that handles sensitive user data, payments, and authentication like an Airbnb clone. Below are the key security measures implemented in this project:

### 1. **Authentication**
Uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to ensure that only registered users can access protected endpoints. This prevents unauthorized access and protects user sessions.

### 2. **Authorization**
Enforces role-based access control, allowing only hosts to manage properties and only guests to make bookings. This prevents users from performing actions outside their permission level.

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
Limits the number of requests a user can make within a certain time frame to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse of the API.

### 4. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
Validates all incoming data to avoid injection attacks and ensures only safe, expected input is processed by the system.

### 5. **Secure Payment Handling**
Ensures that sensitive payment data is transmitted and stored securely, possibly by integrating with trusted third-party payment processors.

### 🔒 Why API Security Matters

- **Protecting User Data**: Ensures that personal information such as email, passwords, and payment methods are kept safe.
- **Preventing Unauthorized Access**: Ensures only the right users can perform actions like listing properties or making bookings.
- **Maintaining Platform Trust**: A secure application builds user trust and ensures compliance with best practices and industry standards.

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**, a set of practices that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. CI/CD pipelines help streamline development workflows, reduce manual errors, and ensure rapid and reliable delivery of application updates.

### 🔄 Importance of CI/CD in This Project

- **Continuous Integration** ensures that all code pushed to the repository is automatically tested and validated, reducing bugs and integration issues.
- **Continuous Deployment** allows for seamless and automated delivery of new features and updates to the production environment, increasing development speed and consistency.
- Helps maintain **code quality**, **reliability**, and **team productivity**, especially in collaborative environments.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates tasks like running tests, checking code quality, and deploying the application when new code is pushed.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production by packaging the application into containers.
- **(Optional)**: Other tools such as Jenkins or Travis CI can also be integrated for advanced workflows.
